What you have in your hands is the Flyte Engine, an extremely easy way to build platform games in Actionscript 3. Unfortunately, while the engine itself is pretty stable, there is no documentation to be had anywhere. This effectively makes it an extremely difficult way to build games. Feel free to poke around until I get some tutorial videos online.
