# The Flyte Engine #
Flyte is a game engine for Actionscript 3 that makes it easy to create scrolling games within the Flash IDE or with Flex. It was designed with ease of use in mind, which means an emphasis on minimizing the code you have to type and finding creative ways to leverage (is that even a word?) the Flash workspace.

Whether you are an experienced AS3 developer or just getting started with Flash, the Flyte engine makes it a breeze to build your game just by drawing your artwork and following the naming guidelines for frames and movieclips. Here are just a few things that Flyte handles for you:

  * Pixel-perfect bitmap-based collision detection
  * Game initialization, event handling, and level management
  * Level elements like barriers, ladders, switches, and platforms
  * Tweening game elements without animation or code
  * Game element animation
  * Character-based gameplay and keyboard input
  * Enemies and AI
  * Checkpoints, goals, and hazards
  * Collectibles (health, coins, and powerups)
  * Projectiles like bullets and grenades

In fact, Flyte is so simple that it only takes one, count 'em, one line of code to start your game. This means you can add a character, enemies, moving platforms, switches, barriers, traps, hazards, checkpoints, and goals without ever seeing, hearing, or smelling any Actionscript.

Well, okay, I lied. There is one line of Actionscript.

If you're eager to try out Flyte, please keep in mind that while the engine works perfectly, there is almost no documentation to be found other than the sort-of-almost-kinda finished API Reference, although I will put up some tutorials in the coming weeks.
